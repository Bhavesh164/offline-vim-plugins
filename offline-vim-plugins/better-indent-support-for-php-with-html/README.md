## About

> This script allows you to indent HTML sections in PHP files

This is just a plugin wrapper around [Christian J. Robinson](http://christianrobinson.name/vim/)'s "[Better indent support for php with html](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Better_indent_support_for_php_with_html)" script from the Vim Wiki.

Many thanks to Mr. Robinson. Indenting html within php view files had been my main pain point with Vim until I discovered this script.

## Installation

* [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) - Add the following line to your `.vimrc`:
    `Bundle 'captbaritone/better-indent-support-for-php-with-html'`
